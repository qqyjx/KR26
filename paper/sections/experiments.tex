\section{Experimental Evaluation}\label{sec:experiments}

We evaluate \textsc{Argus} on two established benchmarks to answer three questions:
(Q1)~Do the formal properties from \S\ref{sec:theory} hold in practice?
(Q2)~Does the minimal-change repair operator improve faithfulness and contestability w.r.t.\ existing baselines?
(Q3)~What is the empirical cost of repair?

Concretely, we sample 500 instances from HotpotQA~\cite{yang2018hotpotqa}, a multi-hop question-answering benchmark, and 500 from FEVER~\cite{thorne2018fever}, a fact-verification benchmark; instances are drawn with seed 42.
For each instance, we withhold one gold supporting fact during explanation generation and reintroduce it as an evidence update~$\Delta$, producing adversarial updates that target the reasoning chain.
GPT-4o~\cite{openai2023gpt4} (\texttt{gpt-4o-2024-11-20}) generates initial explanations at temperature~0.2; relation discovery uses DeBERTa-v3-large fine-tuned on MultiNLI with threshold~0.7; repairs are computed by clingo~5.6 with $k{=}3$ under uniform cost.
Results for \textsc{Argus} and the eight argumentation-based and self-correction methods are averaged over 5 runs, with standard deviation at most~0.02 for accuracy metrics and at most~0.4 for cost; FLARE and FactScore use a single deterministic run (greedy decoding and fixed retrieval scoring, respectively, making repeated runs redundant).  Further details appear in Appendix~\ref{app:exp-details}.

Six metrics quantify performance along distinct dimensions.
\emph{Faithfulness} is the fraction of argument units whose removal via counterfactual ablation changes the answer; baselines without structured units undergo the same LLM-based decomposition before ablation (details in Appendix~\ref{app:exp-details}).
\emph{Contestability} is the fraction of gold counterarguments correctly integrated as attacks; gold counterarguments are derived from the withheld supporting facts (Appendix~\ref{app:exp-details}). For methods that lack an explicit argumentation framework---specifically FLARE and FactScore---gold counterarguments are evaluated against their output decomposed into proposition units via the same LLM-based procedure used for faithfulness, enabling direct comparison.
\emph{Repair accuracy} records answer correctness after repair, and \emph{repair cost} counts edit operations per Definition~\ref{def:repair}.
\emph{Coherence} measures the semantic consistency of repaired explanations via BERTScore~\cite{zhang2020bertscore} between repaired and original explanations; methods without repair capability receive N/A.
\emph{Solve time} is the wall-clock time per instance including all repair computation.

We compare against ten baselines spanning three categories. \emph{Self-correction methods:} SelfCheckGPT~\cite{manakul2023selfcheckgpt}, Self-Refine~\cite{madaan2023selfrefine}, Reflexion~\cite{shinn2023reflexion}, and RARR~\cite{gao2023rarr}. \emph{Verification-oriented methods:} CoT-Verifier~\cite{ling2023deductive}, ArgLLMs~\cite{freedman2025arglm}, FLARE~\cite{jiang2023flare}, and FactScore~\cite{min2023factscore}; ArgLLMs, CoT-Verifier, and FactScore lack repair functionality and are marked N/A accordingly. \emph{Argumentation-based:} ARGORA~\cite{argora2026} and a na\"{i}ve \emph{Regenerate} baseline that re-prompts with updated evidence.
For self-correction baselines and FLARE, repair cost counts regenerated argument units (surface-level replacements) across up to 3 rounds; cost measures are not directly commensurable with \textsc{Argus}'s structural graph edits, as discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:exp-details}.
Chain-of-Verification~\cite{dhuliawala2024cove} and CRITIC~\cite{gou2024critic} are excluded as they operate at generation time rather than post-hoc repair; SelfRAG~\cite{asai2024selfrag} and VerifyAndEdit~\cite{zhao2023verify} are excluded as they require a retrieval index at inference time and produce unstructured outputs incommensurable with structural graph repair.

\end{table*}

Table~\ref{tab:main} summarizes the main results. \textsc{Argus} achieves the highest faithfulness (\resultFaithHotpot{}/\resultFaithFEVER{}) and contestability (\resultContestHotpot{}/\resultContestFEVER{}), with relative improvements of \improveFaithfulness{} in faithfulness and \improveContestability{} in contestability over ARGORA; all 12 pairwise differences are significant at $p < 0.001$ under Bonferroni-corrected two-sided $z$-tests, with Cohen's $h$ effect sizes of $0.28$/$0.38$ (HotpotQA) and $0.26$/$0.36$ (FEVER) for faithfulness/contestability gains, indicating small-to-medium practical magnitudes.  Among repair-capable methods, \textsc{Argus} requires the fewest operations---\resultRepairCostHotpot{} vs.\ 5.1 for ARGORA---validating the minimal-change objective.  FLARE and FactScore achieve moderate faithfulness but lack argumentation structure, yielding low contestability (.505/.482 and .558/.535).  The na\"{i}ve Regenerate baseline achieves the lowest faithfulness among argumentation-based methods (.709/.695) and fastest solve time (0.5\,s) but cannot produce contestability scores; its coherence (.65/.63)---the lowest among repair methods---confirms that complete regeneration disrupts consistency more than targeted structural repair.

\textsc{Argus} also achieves the highest coherence at .82/.80, indicating that minimal-change repair preserves explanation structure better than rewriting-based methods such as Self-Refine, which scores .72/.70. We note that BERTScore coherence is structurally aligned with the minimal-change objective (minimizing edit distance simultaneously maximizes BERTScore), so the coherence advantage partly reflects the design; human evaluators independently corroborate it, rating \textsc{Argus} higher on coherence than Self-Refine (4.1 vs.\ 3.8, $p{=}0.012$; Appendix~\ref{app:human-eval}). The average solve time of 0.55\,s/0.47\,s is competitive with verification-only methods and 5--10$\times$ faster than self-correction methods (2.8--5.8\,s), reflecting ASP-based repair efficiency over iterative LLM regeneration. The formal properties from \S\ref{sec:theory} are confirmed empirically: success and inclusion hold by construction; vacuity holds without exception (5\% of HotpotQA and 8\% of FEVER instances where the withheld fact was not on the reasoning path).

Figure~\ref{fig:scalability} traces solve time on synthetic Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi frameworks (attack probability 0.15, 50 instances per size), confirming polynomial scaling for grounded semantics (Theorem~\ref{thm:complexity}); the $k$-neighborhood approximation keeps preferred repair tractable up to $|\mathcal{A}|{=}50$ (2.31s vs.\ 158.4s unconstrained).

Table~\ref{tab:ablation} reports ablation results on both benchmarks; trends are consistent across datasets. Removing semantic verification causes the largest drops in faithfulness ($-$5.4pp/$-$5.4pp) and contestability ($-$7.7pp/$-$7.6pp), confirming that formal verification is the most critical component. Replacing minimal-change with unconstrained repair preserves faithfulness but increases cost from \resultRepairCostHotpot{}/\resultRepairCostFEVER{} to 5.7/5.2 and reduces coherence, confirming that cost minimization limits unnecessary edits. Removing attack templates reduces contestability by 9.3pp/9.0pp while reducing faithfulness by only 2.6pp/2.5pp---a targeted impact specific to attack structure. Grounded-only semantics yields the fastest solve time (0.15\,s/0.12\,s) and lowest repair cost (3.0/2.6) at the expense of modest faithfulness and contestability drops; 97\% of frameworks have a single preferred extension coinciding with the grounded one, so preferred semantics is necessary only in complex multi-extension cases. Sensitivity analysis and a qualitative repair example appear in Appendices~\ref{app:sensitivity}--\ref{app:repair-example}.

\caption{Distribution of repair costs.  83\% of HotpotQA and 90\% of FEVER repairs require at most 4~operations, confirming targeted, minimal-change edits.}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:cost-dist} shows repair cost distributions concentrated at low values---means of \resultRepairCostHotpot{}/\resultRepairCostFEVER{} operations---confirming that most evidence updates require only local adjustments. The modal cost is 3 on HotpotQA, accounting for 27\% of instances, and 2 on FEVER at 26\%, reflecting FEVER's simpler reasoning chains.

A pilot human evaluation corroborates the automatic metrics; details appear in Appendix~\ref{app:human-eval}. Two annotators rated 75 HotpotQA instances in a blind design, preferring \textsc{Argus} in 68\% of comparisons vs.\ Self-Refine in 19\%, with inter-annotator agreement of $\kappa{=}0.62$; faithfulness ratings were 3.9 vs.\ 3.4 ($p{<}0.001$) and coherence ratings 4.1 vs.\ 3.8 ($p{=}0.012$). The Pearson correlation between automatic faithfulness and human ratings is $r{=}0.78$ ($p{<}0.001$), supporting counterfactual ablation as a proxy for human-perceived faithfulness.
